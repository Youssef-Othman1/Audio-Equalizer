# Audio-Equalizer
Audio Equalizer using MATLAB

Inputs to program:
User should input the following:
1) The wave file name (Q3 is made as default and added to repository as it contains a range of frequencies).
2) Gain of each of the frequency bands in db.
3) Type of filters used (FIR-IIR)
4) Output sample rate.

What the program implements:
1) Develop the frequency band filters in the following bands
( 0- 170 Hz) - ( 170- 310 Hz) - ( 310- 600 Hz) -( 600- 1000 Hz) -( 1- 3 KHz) - ( 3- 6 KHz) - ( 6- 12 KHz) - ( 12-14 KHz) - ( 14-16 KHz).
2) Analyze and display these files (Gain, phase, impulse and step response, order and poles/zeros).
3) Filter the wave file using the filters developed in step 1.
4) Draw the output signals in time and frequency domains.
5) Amplify the output signals using the user defined gain.
6) Add the amplified - output signals in time domain to form composite signal.
7) Draw and compare the composite signal with the original signal. (in time and frequency)
8) Play and save the output wave signal.
